                                    I'm from Singapore, and I moved to Sydney, Australia in 2019.

                                    My background is in the banking industry, and in my previous worklife, I used to work closely with our in-house IT teams. What they do behind the scenes intrigued me so I finally signed up for the coding bootcamp to find out for myself the intricacies of coding and I'm really enjoying it so far!

                                    In the short term, I'd love to be able to combine my work experience and the knowledge I'm gaining in full stack development today in a role that allows me to utilise my organizational experience, technical skills and creativity. In the long run, I want to run a business that serves a need in the society, working with great people and enjoying every moment of my work.

                            I have a Chihuahua dog called Pebbles, and she is the sweetest pup I could ever ask for. She's
                            ferocious with other people and dogs, but that's only because she's terrified of the world and
                            how much bigger everything else seems to be!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We love going on long walks in the park with Pebbles. She has a lot of fun running
                            in the open field, at times trailing at our feet and at other times, sprinting faster than we ever
                            could.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She loves being in her own little world with us, and we love her to bits. ‚ù§
